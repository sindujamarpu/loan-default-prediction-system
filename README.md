# loan-default-prediction-system

This project demonstrates a production-ready ML pipeline with modular architecture and real-time inference using FastAPI.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Financial institutions need to assess whether a loan applicant is likely to default or not.  
This project builds a machine learning system to automate loan approval decisions based on applicant details such as income, loan amount, and credit history.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- YAML (for configuration)

- The `artifacts/` folder stores trained models and preprocessing objects generated during pipeline execution.

## System Architecture

The system follows an end-to-end ML pipeline:

User Input → FastAPI → Data Preprocessing → Trained ML Model → Prediction → JSON Response

## 🔄 ML Pipeline Flow

1. Data Ingestion – Load and split dataset  
2. Data Validation - Validates data quality and schema consistency before further processing.
3. Data Transformation – Handle missing values, scaling, encoding   
4. Model Training – Train ML model  
5. Model Evaluation – Evaluate performance  
6. Prediction Pipeline – Perform inference using saved artifacts 
7. FastAPI – Serve predictions via API 

## 📊 Model Performance

The model was evaluated using standard classification metrics:

| Metric     | Score |
|------------|-------|
| Accuracy   | 0.84  |
| Precision  | 0.83  |
| Recall     | 0.98  |
| F1 Score   | 0.90  |

The high recall suggests the model minimizes false negatives, which is important in loan approval scenarios.

## 🤖 Model Used

- Algorithm: Random Forest 
- Reason: Provides good balance between accuracy and interpretability
- Training Type: Supervised Classification
